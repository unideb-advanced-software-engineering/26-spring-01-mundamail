title: Architectural Style
description: The architectural styles chosen for the project are as follows
---


Event-driven architecture.
Modular monolith.

## Why two styles?
Munda-Mail (as a complete system) can be modeled into one deployable unit with clean internal boundaries, and
asynchronous event flow for everything that touches performance, compliance, and scale with different quality
characteristics and ASRs:

Auth Module, Messaging Module. API bridge, Admin Module
Role Based Access Control (RBAC) Module, Attachment Check Module

Pure microservices approach is over-engineered for a government messaging platform operated by a single team,
while a classic monolith can't meet the performance and audit ASRs. The hybrid sits in the sweet spot.

## Why EDA?
### Fit
EDA decouples API response from delivery; Messaging queue partitions handle burst load

The system must handle high-volume, high-concurrency workloads without making the caller wait. The message queue
solves all three through the same core mechanism, decouple the act of accepting work from the act of doing work.

## Trade-offs
However, the following points should not be overlooked:

## Why a Modular Monolith?
### Fit
Module boundaries without network contracts guarantees safe cross-module refactoring

low cost,
simplicity,
maintainability.
The modular monolith architectural style perfectly meets these quality criteria.

## Trade-offs
At the same time, we must be mindful of the following trade-offs:
